## HeaderAnimationView
* Right now the `HeaderAnimationView` is hardcoded to display Jennifer C. and her profile picture. Add an initialization function that takes in a User and displays their info.
* Tweak the `HeaderAnimationView` keyframe offsets and see what happens.

### StatusTableViewCell
* Currently `StatusTableViewCell` displays comments and like counts unformatted. For example it would display 12,000 comments as 12000 comments. Add formatting to both comments and likes count. Extra points if you can make it localized, so that it displays decimal commas in countries that use that. (ex: 12000 would be 12.000)
* Add the location name to the `StatusTableViewCell`. Note: The pin icon is included in the assets folder.
